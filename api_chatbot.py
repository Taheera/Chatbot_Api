Speed walking, swimming, or stationary bike riding 30 minutes daily can increase muscle strength and flexibility. Yoga also can help stretch and strengthen muscles and improve posture. Consult a physician for a list of low-impact, age-appropriate exercises that are specifically targeted to strengthening lower back and abdominal muscles.\n\nAlways stretch before exercise or other strenuous physical activity.\nDon\u2019t slouch when standing or sitting. The lower back can support a person\u2019s weight most easily when the curvature is reduced. When standing, keep your weight balanced on your feet.\nAt home or work, make sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height.\nSit in a chair with good lumbar support and proper position and height for the task. Keep shoulders back. Switch sitting positions often and periodically walk around the office or gently stretch muscles to relieve tension. A pillow or rolled-up towel placed behind the small of the back can provide some lumbar support. During prolonged periods of sitting, elevate feet on a low stool or a stack of books.\nWear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.\nSleeping on one\u2019s side with the knees drawn up in a fetal position can help open up the joints in the spine and relieve pressure by reducing the curvature of the spine. Always sleep on a firm surface.\nDon\u2019t try to lift objects that are too heavy. Lift from the knees, pull the stomach muscles in, and keep the head down and in line with a straight back. When lifting, keep objects close to the body. Do not twist when lifting.\nMaintain proper nutrition and diet to reduce and prevent excessive weight gain, especially weight around the waistline that taxes lower back muscles. A diet with sufficient daily intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D helps to promote new bone growth.\nQuit smoking. Smoking reduces blood flow to the lower spine, which can contribute to spinal disc degeneration. Smoking also increases the risk of osteoporosis and impedes healing. Coughing due to heavy smoking also may cause back pain."}, {"ID": 6.0, "FOL": "get(pain,acute back pain)", "Pattern": "VBNNINNN", "Question": "when do you get the pain in acute back pain?", "Answers": "Usually one first feel back pain just after you lift a heavy object, move suddenly, sit in one position for a long time, or have an injury or accident."}, {"ID": 7.0, "FOL": "(different Antidepressants,osteoarthritis)", "Pattern": "NNINNN", "Question": "what are different Antidepressants for osteoarthritis?", "Answers": "amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane), imipramine (Tofranil, Norfranil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl)."}, {"ID": 8.0, "FOL": "cure(Lower back pain,research)", "Pattern": "NNVBNN", "Question": "What research is being done to cure Lower back pain?", "Answers": "The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is the leading federal funder of research on disorders of the brain and nervous system. As a primary supporter of research on pain and pain mechanisms, NINDS is a member of the NIH Pain Consortium, which was established to promote collaboration among the many NIH Institutes and Centers with research programs and activities addressing pain. On an even broader scale, NIH participates in the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, a federal advisory committee that coordinates research across other U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agencies as well as the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.\n\nNINDS-funded studies are contributing to a better understanding of why some people with acute low back pain recover fully while others go on to develop chronic low back pain. Brain imaging studies suggest that people with chronic low back pain have changes in brain structure and function. In one study, people with subacute back pain were followed for one year. Researchers found that certain patterns of functional connectivity across brain networks correlated with the likelihood of pain becoming chronic. The findings suggest that such patterns may help predict who is most likely to transition from subacute to chronic back pain. Other research seeks to determine the role of brain circuits important for emotional and motivational learning and memory in this transition, in order to identify new preventive interventions.\n\nDisc degeneration remains a key cause of chronic low back pain and the pain often persists despite surgery. NIH-funded basic science and preclinical studies are investigating molecular-level mechanisms that cause discs in the spine to degenerate, as well as protective mechanisms involved in disc remodeling that may diminish with advancing age. Such studies may help identify future therapeutic strategies to block degenerative mechanisms or promote remodeling processes. NIH also is funding early research on stem cell approaches to promote disc regeneration and rejuvenate cells of the nucleus pulposus, the jelly-like substance in the center of intervertebral discs that loses water content as people age.\n\nSeveral NIH-funded clinical trials and other studies in patients aim to improve treatment options and prevention strategies for chronic low back pain, as well as add to the evidence base about existing treatments. A multi-year multicenter study called the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) compared the most commonly used surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with the three most common diagnoses for which spine surgery is performed: intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylisthesis. SPORT represented the largest clinical investigation to date looking at treatment results for these disabling and costly causes of chronic low back pain.\n\nResults after four years of follow-up showed that in general, otherwise healthy people who have surgery for one of these three conditions are likely to fare better than those who receive non-operative care. However, the results also indicated that people who are reluctant to have surgery may also recover with non-operative treatments if their conditions are not progressing and their pain is tolerable, and importantly, delaying or avoiding surgery did not cause additional damage in most cases. Researchers are continuing to track SPORT patient cohorts over a nine-year follow-up period to assess longer term treatment results and cost effectiveness across treatment options. In the interest of improving surgical techniques, NIH also is funding research on factors that contribute to the success or failure of artificial disc replacement surgery, including studies to compare discs on the market for significant differences in their durability rates over time.\n\nEpidural injections of steroid drugs are frequently used to treat sciatica, despite limited evidence for their effectiveness. Moreover, these treatments are based on the assumption that reducing local inflammation in the vertebral column will relieve pain, but an association between structural abnormalities, inflammation, and sciatica symptoms has not been clearly demonstrated. NINDS-funded researchers are using a new imaging technique that can detect inflammation to better understand what causes chronic sciatica pain and to provide evidence to inform treatment selection.\n\nOther NIH-funded studies are investigating physical therapy and chiropractic approaches. For example, researchers are studying whether therapy programs that emphasize certain types of exercises, such as core stabilization exercises, provide benefit to people who experience recurrent low back pain.\n\nThe increasing use of spinal manipulation and mobilization, despite lacking evidence for more than small or moderate benefit, has prompted NIH-funded researchers to study the mechanisms of these two techniques and to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess and compare their effectiveness for the treatment of chronic low back pain.\n\nFinally, NIH-funded researchers are studying various complementary and alternative therapies for low back pain, including those aimed reducing stress and negative emotions believed to aggravate the experience of pain. For example, virtual reality programs are being studied for their ability to help people cope with persistent pain."}, {"ID": 9.0, "FOL": "(acute back pain)", "Pattern": "NN", "Question": "How long will the acute back pain last?", "Answers": "Acute back pain can last for a few days to a few weeks."}, {"ID": 10.0, "FOL": "(Intra-articular injections,osteoarthritis treatment)", "Pattern": "NNINNN", "Question": "what is an Intra-articular injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis?", "Answers": "Intra-articular injections of cortisone made directly into the arthritic joint can also provide pain relief. Ultrasound-guided cortisone injections using dedicated high-resolution ultrasound equipment are very precise and allow a radiologist to target the injections directly into an area, maximizing therapeutic outcomes. Following the injection, pain relief varies from patient to patient. Some may feel relief from pain within two to five days. If a patient feels no relief within ten days following the injection, the patient is unlikely to gain any additional improvement and further discussion with your physician may be needed to identify other treatment options.\n\n"}, {"ID": 11.0, "FOL": "(pharmacological treatments,osteoarthritis pain)", "Pattern": "NNINNN", "Question": "What are some of the pharmacological treatments for osteoarthritis pain?", "Answers": "Analgesics, NSAIDs, Topical Pain Relievers, COX-2 Inhibitors, Tramadol, Stronger Painkillers, Antidepressants."}, {"ID": 12.0, "FOL": "alleviate(osteoarthritis pain,activity modifications)", "Pattern": "NNVBNN", "Question": "What activity modifications can be done to help alleviate osteoarthritis pain?", "Answers": "Respect Pain\n\nPerform activities only up to the point of slight fatigue or discomfort. Then take a break - at least until pain disappears before starting again.\nRecognize that pain lasting more than two hours after an activity is a warning sign. Don't push yourself that far again.\nUse a warm heating pad for morning pain and stiffness, or use ice packs on warm and swollen joints.\nAsk your physician about alternate activities if your exercise regimen is causing you significant pain. For example, if playing tennis exacerbates your pain, try swimming instead.\nDiscuss any persistent pain with your physician.\nPlan Ahead - Balance Your Activities\n\nPrioritize your daily activities, making sure to include rest and relaxation, as well as work and exercise.\nSpread out light and heavy tasks throughout the day.\nBe realistic about what you can do. Delegate tasks that will put you at risk for injury, or just ask for help.\nDo the exercises your physician recommends for your specific condition. Get involved in additional exercise - as long as it's appropriate for you - since building muscle around the joints protects them.\nConserve your energy. Make sure the supplies you use most are the easiest to reach, which may require the installation of lower shelves. Sit often. Eliminate unnecessary tasks. Use electric appliances rather than your own muscle power whenever possible.\nEnhance flexibility and mobility by changing your position frequently. Stretch every 15 minutes when writing or using a computer. Avoid long periods of standing, sitting, and lying down.\nDistribute Work Over Your Body, Using Your Largest, Strongest Joints\n\nAvoid placing excessive weight or strain on any single joint. Spread the weight of an object or task over several joints to limit the stress on a single joint. Get the shoulder, elbow and wrist involved in lifting - not just the fingers. For example, lift, carry and hold items with both hands. Use both hands or the side of your body to open heavy doors. Hold small items in the palm of your hand, not your fingers.\nKeep items close to your body. \"Hugging\" packages is safer than carrying them on one side or in one hand.\nUse a bag with shoulder straps rather than holding it in your hand, if it is heavy.\nWhen using stairs, lead with your strong leg as you go up the stairs and with your weaker leg as you go down. This will limit the stress on the weaker joints. Use a hand rail.\nUse Joints in Their Most Stable Position\n\nFor example, if you have wrist problems, don't stir by rotating your wrist. Instead, grip the spoon in your fist, with the spoon end exiting on the pinky side of your hand, and stir (thumb up) using your whole arm and keeping the wrist stable.\nAvoid twisting motions. This is especially important for people who have back or hip pain - and for those with hand problems. Wringing motions stress fingers and encourage deformities. Don't wring out washcloths; just drape them over the faucet to dry. This also may require a little home redecorating to replace your doorknobs with lever door opening devices.\nUse Adaptive Devices and Techniques\n\nUse built-up handles made of foam or plastic for holding toothbrushes, pencils, and pens.\nUse a cane to alleviate knee or hip pain. Remember, use the cane in the hand opposite your painful joint. For example, if your right knee hurts, hold the cane in your left hand.\nAlternate hands when opening and closing jars or use a special device designed for people with limited strength or motion in their hands.\nUse reachers or other devices to pick up items from the floor or to retrieve them from a high shelf.\nWear proper safety equipment, e.g., knee or wrist pads.\nCheck out websites, catalogs and stores that sell products specifically designed for people with arthritis or other conditions that limit movement.\nMaintain Correct Posture\n\nKeep your back straight, especially important when lifting large objects.\nBend at the knees and hips, not at the waist.\nSeparate feet to widen your base of support.\nKeep the item you are lifting close to your body.\nStand on a low, stable footstool when reaching for high objects.\nUse a firm chair with good arms and back support. Use a tall chair to make sitting down and standing easier.\nSeek exercises that strengthen your posture.\nGet familiar with ergonomics, especially if your work requires constant sitting or repetitive motion. Your company's human resources department may be able to help.\nControl Your Weight\n\nLosing extra pounds can make a difference in your prognosis. For example, your knees sustain an impact three to five times your body weight when you descend stairs. If you weigh 200 pounds, that means up to 1000 pounds banging on your knees. If you are very overweight, any loss of weight will be beneficial.\nGet advice from your physician about a healthy diet for you to follow.

As people grow older, loss of bone strength from osteoporosis can lead to fractures, and at the same time, muscle elasticity and tone decrease. The intervertebral discs begin to lose fluid and flexibility with age, which decreases their ability to cushion the vertebrae.

Back symptoms almost always resolve postpartum.\n\nWeight gain: Being overweight, obese, or quickly gaining significant amounts of weight can put stress on the back and lead to low back pain.\n\nGenetics: Some causes of back pain, such as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that involves fusion of the spinal joints leading to some immobility of the spine, have a genetic component.\n\nOccupational risk factors: Having a job that requires heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling, particularly when it involves twisting or vibrating the spine, can lead to injury and back pain. An inactive job or a desk job may also lead to or contribute to pain, especially if you have poor posture or sit all day in a chair with inadequate back support.\n\nMental health factors: Pre-existing mental health issues such as anxiety and depression can influence how closely one focuses on their pain as well as their perception of its severity. Pain that becomes chronic also can contribute to the development of such psychological factors.
